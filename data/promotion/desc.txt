You find yourself face to face with a seemingly friendly Mario, the host of a new show; Nintendo Mania! Here, he presents Nintendo's "hottest new video game releases", and is presenting Super Mario 64 in this first installment. His brother Luigi stands in for him in the game while he conducts his presentation, but as things begin to go wrong for Luigi, this seemingly friendly Mario shows his not so friendly side.                                                   Based on Greenio's SM64: Classified
